I have got 15+ years of teaching experience in both Maths and Physics and proven my ability to prepare the students for the exams to get higher grades. I am able to tutor Maths and Physics to GCSE, IGCSE or, AS, A-Level. Also, I am focussed and goal-driven, able to cater for all of the major exam boards, specially AQA, Edexcel, OCR, and CIE. Professionally I am a Senior Engineer specialized in Civil Engineering and Structural Design, working for a design and construction company, while working as a part-time tutor.\r\nTutoring Experience\r\nI am a passionate and experienced teacher committed to helping students to achieve the best results. I have got about 15 years of teaching experience having many no of the students who proved the rate of success is high. If need references available. I am able to assist students in building their confidence, reaching their full potentials and stretching their abilities whilst maintaining high academic performances.\r\nMaths and Physics are everywhere in our everyday life. I use my Engineering knowledge and the work experience to teach both Maths and Physics through real-world examples which enormously help students to understand the fundamentals and build their in-depth knowledge to develop their problem-solving skills to get higher grades in the exams.\r\nAlso, I am able to cater to all of the major exam boards, specially AQA, Edexcel, OCR, and CIE.\r\nLesson Planning\r\nMy approach is simple but logical - I always plan the tutoring program according to the individual needs of the student. I use past papers to prepare for the exams and improve the grade. I ensure that the student understands the basic concepts and can successfully and independently apply them to answer the exam questions. Also, my teaching style is friendly and approachable to students who require to ask any questions or discuss any areas of difficulty. This method is appreciated by the students.
